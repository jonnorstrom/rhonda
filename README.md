# rhonda
A SlackApp for quick, semantic feedback
By [Trev](http://trev.com/about/) & [Jon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norstromjonathan)

This is meant for leaving quick, anonymous feedback within your teammates on any given [Slack](https://slack.com/) Channel.

1. Type `/rhonda` into the text box

2. Type the feedback you'd like to give in the following format: 4 stars to @johndoe for going out of his way to help our new teammate understand the code-base.

3. The syntax for the sentence is `/rhonda [#] [badge type] to [@someone] for [doing something]` and it is very important to include the **to** and the **for** in their respectful places otherwise you could end up with unintended results.

4. For the time being, avoid using commas in your quantity. Type 3589 instead of 3,983.
